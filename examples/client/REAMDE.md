## Client Examples

- `index.js` is a fairly standard client implementation for subscribing to specific
Journal events
- `basic.js` is a barebones client implementation for listening to Journal events
- `discovery.js` utilizes network discovery via Zeroconf/Bonjour to discover a Journal
Server and connect to it

**NOTE**: The `discover.js` example is the only one that can be run without the server
already up and running.
